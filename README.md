# customer_churn_predictive_analysis
objectives:

1. To build a model on top of the customer_churn dataset:
              a. To find out how does ‘tenure’ change/vary w.r.t change in ‘MonthlyCharges’ of the customer
              b. To find out how does ‘tenure’ change/vary w.r.t change in ‘TotalCharges’ of the customer.
              c. To understand which factor influences the ‘tenure’ of the customer more ‘MonthlyCharges’ or ‘TotalCharges’

2. To build another model on top of the ‘customer_churn’ dataset:
              a. To find out if the customer would ‘Churn’ or not w.r.t the ‘PaymentMethod’ used by the customer
              b. To find out if the customer would ‘Churn’ or not w.r.t the ‘Contract’ type of the customer.
              c. To find out if the customer would ‘Churn’ or not w.r.t the ‘MonthlyCharges’ incurred by the customer
              d. To understand which factor influences the ‘Churn’ of the customer more ->‘PaymentMethod’, ‘Contract’ or                        ‘MonthlyCharges’
